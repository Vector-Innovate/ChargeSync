# Project Vector Innovate -  network of charging stations and solar energy partners to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation.

## Overview
Our EV Smart Solar Charging application is designed to help Tier 2 & 3 cities and suburban households in India easily apply for the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana to set up solar panels and benefit from government-subsidized electricity. The platform simplifies the application process and enables users to monetize surplus solar power by setting up wall-mounted EV chargers at discounted rates and earning revenue by allowing EV users to charge at standard commercial rates. This decentralizes EV charging infrastructure, reduces congestion at centralized stations, and accelerates EV adoption by making charging convenient, accessible, and affordable. Key features include a user-friendly interface for applying to the PM Surya Ghar Yojana, real-time tracking of application status, eligibility verification, and discounted wall-mounted EV charger setups. Households can list their chargers as public charging points, allowing seamless digital payments and real-time charger availability updates. The intelligent EV charging network enables smart location mapping, live charger status, and user reviews. The platform helps eliminate reliance on centralized charging stations, supports EV adoption, and creates a widespread EV charging network in suburban and rural areas. Users benefit from government-subsidized solar energy, passive income, and contribution to green energy, while EV owners gain access to more charging stations, affordable pricing, and real-time charger availability. The app monetizes through a one-time basic fee for application processing, discounted charger sales, and a small transaction fee on public charging. This initiative promotes renewable energy, expands EV infrastructure in underserved regions, and boosts EV sales while empowering households to become energy entrepreneurs. Users can download the app, sign up, apply for PM Surya Ghar Yojana, purchase and install a charger, and start earning or charging their EVs. Join the Green Energy & EV Revolution Today!
